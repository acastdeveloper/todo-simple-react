# HOW IT WAS MADE

1. I've created a react app. (`yarn create react-app tudutudu` on *terminal*).

2. I've created folder **components**  inside **src**.

3. in order to manage tasks (addition, edition and deleting tasks) I create a component TasksForm.js on /src/components/

4. I've created a git branch called ***dev*** in order to separete our work from production.

5. From ***dev*** I've created a branch ***form-addition-tasks*** to develope this functionallity.

6. Once inside this branch I create a simple **form** with nostyles. I commit "*Basic HTML Form in order to add tasks*").
